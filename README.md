A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a 
computer system. The database management system(DBMS) is a software that interacts with end 
user, applications and the database itself to capture and analyze the data and provides facilities to 
administer the database. Primary goal of database management system is to provide a way to store 
and retrieve database information that is convenient and efficient.
Car Showroom Management System is a database that stores the information about the cars that are 
available in the Showroom. It also contains information about the dealer who deals with the 
showroom about cars and the customers who purchase it.
This project helps in digitalizing the traditional method that has been used for storing data. This 
project will be secure and helps in systematic way of maintaining the records of the cars.
This project is implemented by using MySql and Java.
